Sunday:

Errands and relaxing after 3 days of work. Not scheduled for work this week. Watched the Cardinals via the $90 NFL Sunday Ticket offer.
Started playing Assassin's Creed: The Directors Cut. Issues due to the old Windows controls. First discretionary spending of the month: $19.99 plus tax.
Watched Mr. WhoseTheBoss YT episode on his $100k smart living room.

Monday: 

Manually built a Wordpress server from scratch and restored old data. Learned much about installing and configuring the LAMP stack. Now have backups in place. Watched several episodes of The Big Bang Theory: Season 1. 

Tuesday:

Watched another 4 episodes of The Big Bang Theory: Season 1. Installed and configured Timeshift for system backups on my Linux laptop. Set up a network share on homelab server to eventually store backups; Timeshift doesn't save snapshots to network drives.

Wednesday:
More Big Bang Theory, almost done with S:2. Worked on Asteroids in Python to add bullet shooting. No collision detection with the asteriods yet, but that's the next step. Started reading ["Building a Second Brain" by Tiago Forte](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book) on my Onyx Boox Palma.


Ideas, Projects and upcoming To-Do's:
- Switch homelab from TrueNas to Unraid mainly because I found Unraid easier to use and it offers more apps / containers.
- Finish Asteriods in Python
- Work on Wishlist application
- Look into using Obsidian as the front end for blog posts going forward. [Simple setup and explanation video here](https://youtu.be/vHKuy7BqMMM?si=Hfr60OBTVuc6gu4L).
