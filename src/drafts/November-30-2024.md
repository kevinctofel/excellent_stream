Sunday:

Errands and relaxing after 3 days of work. Not scheduled for work this week. Watched the Cardinals via the $90 NFL Sunday Ticket offer.
Started playing Assassin's Creed: The Directors Cut. Issues due to the old Windows controls. First discretionary spending of the month: $19.99 plus tax.
Watched Mr. WhoseTheBoss YT episode on his $100k smart living room.

Monday: 

Manually built a Wordpress server from scratch and restored old data. Learned much about installing and configuring the LAMP stack. Now have backups in place. Watched several episodes of The Big Bang Theory: Season 1. 

Tuesday:

Watched another 4 episodes of The Big Bang Theory: Season 1. Installed and configured Timeshift for system backups on my Linux laptop. Set up a network share on homelab server to eventually store backups; Timeshift doesn't save snapshots to network drives.
