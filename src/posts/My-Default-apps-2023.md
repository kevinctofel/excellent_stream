A quick look at my current default applications as of the end of 2023. Most are the same as I used in 2022 with a few exceptions. 

In particular, I've moved away from VS Code, the default Terminal app in Linux, heavy reliance on cloud storage from Google / Apple, and the Chrome browser. Even on my Chromebooks, [I no longer use Chrome as the default browser](https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/sidekick-on-a-chromebook-a-better-browser-for-chromeos/).

While inspiration for this listing comes from many sources over the past month or so, I've borrowed (well, really copied) the lovely looking format with emojis [from Chris Coyier's list](https://chriscoyier.net/2023/11/25/default-apps-2023/).
