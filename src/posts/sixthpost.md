Adding a test post directly in GitHub.

This is just for testing purposes as my CMS project is requesting all of the post title file names. Prior to this post, I was only getting six post titles.

After publishing this post, I hope to see all of the existing post titles plus this new one.

Before:

{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/blog/six_post_titles.jpg", "Six titles shown" %}

UPDATE -- After:

{% imagePlaceholder "./src/assets/images/blog/seven-posts.jpg", "Seven titles shown" %}
