## A wild week

To say this was a crazy, stressful week would be an understatement. Aside from working 36 hours, which kept my tinkering time to a minimum, we're dealing with a medical challenge. I found out back in June that I'd be a grandfather for the first time. My step-daughter Sydney is due in late February early March. Only nobody told the baby.

Sydney's been in the hospital since Monday with bad contractions. With the baby only around 31 or so weeks, it's obviously early. So the hospital is monitoring both mother and daughter in a room next door to the NIC unit. Everyone is trying to hold off on the delivery but Sydney will be in the hospital until she delivers. That could be in hours, days or weeks.

My wife has been traveling back and forth to the hospital every other day or so this week, staying over a few times. Meanwhile, I've been working my shifts, keeping up to date on the situation and taking care of the cat and dog. Needless to say, everyone's stress levels are relatively high. This is where my Stoic adoption comes in handy: Worrying only about what I can control. Right now, it's not much, so I'm just trying to keep everyone steady and positive.



## Ideas, projects and to-dos

[ ] Work on Wishlist application
[ ] Investigage the difference between notes and articles using Eleventy Notes to see if this can all be tied together.
[ ] Draft out a simple web clipping service I can create and self host to save thoughts to this Github repo
[ ] Modify web app for note capture to save notes in a central folder.
[ ] Test Calibre on the home server
