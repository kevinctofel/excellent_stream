## Back to a regular work schedule

After two full weeks off, I went back for 32 hours this week. That really boosts my step count as I average between 4.5 and 7 miles of walking during a shift. But it also tires me out. I come home at 1pm, 2pm, or in one case, 4pm, after work and have zero energy to do the things I **want** to do.

I'm not sure how to mitigate this. Is it afternoon coffee? A short, 90 minute after work nap and hope for enough of a recharge to tinker? I don't know the answer but I have to find one.

## Making the second brain more portable

I'm thrilled with the value I'm getting from journaling (mostly) daily on my personal site. Yes, it's now my personal site as I switched from a Cloudflare development site to [my own domain for hosting the second brain](https://www.kctofel.com). Chalk up at least one "to do" item done this week. I still want to add long-form content to the mix so I have an all-in-one destination for my personal knowledge, journal entries and longform thoughts.

I also want a simple way to capture notes when away from my computer. My phone is the obvious choice here. So I resurrected some old code I put together last year for a Github CMS interface and hooked it up to my second brain site.

You can see the two test notes I created using this interface: They're just text, converted to Markdown and sent to a specific folder in a Github repo for now. It's ugly as sin but functionally it works as an MVP, or minimum viable product. I do have to alter where I save the text notes because I just shipped them into the December folder of my Journal entries for testing. Thinking a "Notes" or "Inbox" folder to hold these is the way to go. So I'll keep working on that this week.

Think I'll call this small utility "GitDatNote". 

## Ideas, Projects and upcoming To-Doâ€™s:

    [ ] Work on Wishlist application
    [X] Move the second brain content to my personal domain.
    [ ] Investigage the difference between notes and articles using Eleventy Notes to see if this can all be tied together.
    [ ] Draft out a simple web clipping service I can create and self host)
    [X] Start building a web app to save thoughts to this Github repo
    [ ] Modify web app for note capture to save notes in a central folder.
