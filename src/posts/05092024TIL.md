description: A cross platform AirDrop-like app, new LoTR movie from Peter Jackson, and a subReddit for where I work

## LocalSend

Given that I use an iPhone, iPad Pro, Windows and Linux, I lean towards cross-platform services. Apple's AirDrop is awesome for shooting files to different devices but of course, it's limited to iOS and macOS devices.

Enter LocalSend, an AirDrop-like app that works with Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's free and open source, [found right here](https://localsend.org/).

A quick test of sending a photo from my iPhone to a Linux laptop worked flawlessly. Definitely a must-have tool in my toolbox.

## A new Lord of the Rings movie

It's true: Peter Jackson isn't done with LoTR just yet. Warner Brothers announced a 2026 movie called "Lord of the Rings: The Hunt for Gollum".

I suspect this will focus on either Aragorn and/or Gandalf chasing down Gollum before the Fellowship of the Ring. That's just a guess, of course. Andy Serkes is heavily involved (as an actor and director), which is fantastic.

More info and thoughts from the esteemed Nerd of the Rings:

## r/Wawa

Who would have guessed that there's a subReddit for a convenience store? I wouldn't have but it's true. [I work part time for Wawa](https://myconscious.stream/blog/Working-at-Wawa/) and there's a big online community to talk about all the Wawa things, such as:

- [AMA's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wawa/comments/1cmaqdn/i_work_at_wawa_ask_me_anything/)
- [Ageism discussions](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wawa/comments/1cn38dq/ageism/)
- [Lisa Rinna loves Wawa coffee](https://www.reddit.com/r/Wawa/comments/1chpr13/lisa_rinna_loves_wawa_coffee/) 

Ok, the last item isn't *that* important, but still....
