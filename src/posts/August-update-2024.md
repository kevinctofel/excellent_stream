I haven't posted a minimalism update [since the beginning of March](https://myconscious.stream/blog/Minimalism-activity-check-for-February/), mainly because I haven't been writing. I suppose after 12,000+ blog posts over two decades, I needed a break.

So here's what's new and what I've been thinking about in terms of simplifying my digital life.

## What I bought

In terms of purchases, I've been very intentional. That's good! In fact, [intentionality is a key part of how I view a minimal life](https://myconscious.stream/blog/Maximum-Minimalism-for-2024/). What did I buy in the past six months then, outside of actual everyday needs?

- 6 pairs of [Mack Weldon underwear](https://mackweldon.com/products/18-hour-jersey-boxer-briefs-solid-grey-heather?syclid=ba6847b1-2821-4bc9-9b9e-b144b1507750&variant=39319573168241). It was time to replace some of my old unmentionables and even though these were expensive, I'm hoping they last several years.
- A [tail bag for my motorcycle](https://www.revzilla.com/motorcycle/ogio-tail-bag-20?utm_campaign=order_confirmation&utm_content=Product&utm_medium=email&utm_source=RevZilla&sku_id=10103386) to carry a few necessary items during a ride. When I ride in to work, I wear motorcycle shoes/boots, so I can carry my work shoes in the bag, for example.
- An [all-natural, 4-inch Japanese Shikibuton](https://jlifeinternational.com/products/j-life-shikifuton?variant=7084498321459), aka: A traditional futon mattress. I sleep on the floor using this and my body feels so much better in the mornings. I used to wake up sore. No longer. I plan to purchase a tatami mat and, possibly, a chair frame to reuse the mattress for seating.
- A refurbished 5th gen iPod Classic ($68 on eBay) and [Koss PortaPro wired headphones](https://koss.com/products/porta-pro?srsltid=AfmBOopwdA-6EGOCcBjvnKfwtg_milm5q1v3kH5OvZXDifva3h3KDT1x) ($28 on sale). I'm enjoying the intentional and undisturbed experience of music with this setup. The 160 GB iPod is stock for now, but there are kits to add [larger batteries, Bluetooth radios and a USB-C port](https://moonlit.market). I don't need any of that right now (or maybe ever) but it's nice to have those options.
- 3 technical [T-shirts from REI](https://www.rei.com/product/153828/rei-co-op-lightweight-base-layer-crew-top-mens), about $30 each. I already had 3 of these, so I replaced 3 older cotton shirt from my minimal wardrobe with these.

So not much spending and I didn't buy anything that I don't use on a daily or regular basis.

## Old tech was simpler

Something else I bought that's not on the list is an original black Pebble watch. Debuting in 2013, this was one of the first truly viable smartwatches. It doesn't compare to today's digital timepieces because it's simpler and has far fewer functions. That's actuallly what got me thinking to get one. I was able to purchase on eBay for $22 plus shipping and it arrives later this week.

Will it replace my Apple Watch LTE model? I'm not sure yet. For the price, I thought it was worth finding out. Of couse, Pebble was bought by Fitbit, which was later acquired by Google. So in 2017, the Pebble Web Services were shut down. And the Pebble companion app, needed for the watch, is no longer available.

However, a group of Pebble enthusiasts created [Rebble.io](https://rebble.io), which is keeping Pebble watches alive. I did follow their instructions to sideload the old Pebble app on my iPhone so when the Pebble arrives, I'll give it a go.

## An iPhone home screen unlike iOS for simplicity

In the meantime, I decided to apply some minimalism to my iPhone 15 Pro. Using an app called [Blank Spaces](https://www.blankspaces.app), my new home screen looks nothing like iOS. Here it is.

Blank Spaces is effectively a clever widget system. Each of the app links open their respective app and I keep a weather widget above those. There's a 7-day trial of Blank Spaces and after using it for a few days, I think I'll pay the subscription fee. 

I've already noticed how this home screen setup has reduced my screen time. My iPhone 15 Pro is now a tool, not an appendage that distracts me throughout the day. I know that when I see tons of app icons, my mind wanders to tap some of them and my intentionality is out the window.

## A super tiny phone?

I'm also _considering_ the switch to a smaller phone. That means no iOS, which brings it's own set of challenges. My entire smarthome is built upon Apple HomeKit devices, for example. If I keep my Apple Watch, I need an iPhone because it's a requirement.

There's much to think about with regards to this choice. And I'm in no rush. But if I think I can have a small phone with the tools I need when out and about -- basic connectivity, a few apps, NFC support, etc -- I may make the move. 

At the moment, I'm looking at the [Jelly Star phone](https://www.unihertz.com/products/jelly-star?srsltid=AfmBOopE-i00xUEgzht0HUEdNjGm_BM8NQzILdLzW5FvcMTRAcvSIFb4d) (~ $200) which runs Android.

Aside from the iOS requirements in my life, it can provide the functions I need when I'm away from home. With a 3-inch touchscreen it's usable but not so much that I'd want to doomscroll or watch hours of video on it. We'll see...
